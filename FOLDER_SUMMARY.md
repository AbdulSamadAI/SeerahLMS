## 🚀 How to Share This Folder

### Option 1: Share the Folder Directly
Simply compress `ppd_c/` into a ZIP file and share:
```
Right-click ppd_c folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder
```

**Important Note:** The `.env` file contains sensitive credentials and is **NOT** included in version control. Recipients will need to:

```
